这篇SMC流程是指在ITA之后，AIP之前，在移民局内部发生的流程。

诶，上岸之路道阻且长。看到一篇skilled mrigrant visa处理流程的[好文章](https://www.enz.org/forum/showthread.php?t=55758&s=1b1e261c8e4a4dea4702769244b2c470)。翻译一下，做个笔记。原文作者号称在移民局工作过，现在是移民顾问。

```
EOI (express of interest)
	-> DS (decision successful)
		-> ITA (invitation to apply))
			-> **你在这里
				-> AIP (approved in principle)
```

当然对于EOI的申请者，移民局的[Operational Manual](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/opsmanual/#6954.htm)是官方详细规定，比移民局前台页面强多了。大家仔细研究申请条件。


## Lodgement 录入

当你提交申请材料给移民局的时候，在Northern Area Documentation Office的一个团队会检查材料是否符合强制标准。强制标准是指有没有签过字的申请表、付款信息、出生证明、护照照片、体验单和警方的犯罪记录。
>
Lodgement – when you send your application and supporting documents to INZ, it goes to a team in the Northern Area Documentation Office who check over all the documents you’ve submitted and decide whether the mandatory lodgement requirements are met. Mandatory lodgement requirements are considered to be a signed application form, payment details, birth certificates, passport photos, medicals, police certificates.

如果以上的材料都齐全，你的申请会被录入并银行扣款。他们会建立一份实体档案，其中包含了你所有提交的文件。体检相关的文件会转给Meical Assessor评估。New Zealand police certificate(新西兰警方证明)移民局会代表你提出申请。如果你的母国是一个需要国家安全检查的国家，那么National Security Check也会开始。这个实体档案会被寄给Manukau的处理团队(SMC Processing Teams)，放到一个叫受理队列(Managed Queue)里，这里按先后顺序堆着大量最近的申请。
>
If all these documents are present, your application will be lodged and payment deducted. A physical file of your application is created, containing all your documents, your medicals are referred to the Medical Assessor if need be, a New Zealand police certificate is applied for on your behalf and a National Security Check is initiated if applicable to your citizenship. The physical file is then sent to the SMC Processing Teams in Manukau, to be put in what is called a Managed Queue, a huge filing cabinet of SMC applications with the most recently lodged applications added to the end of the cabinet.

如果你的材料不全，他们会退还给你，并附上一封信，向你解释你必须交齐材料移民局才能接收你的申请。根据标准流程(Standard Operating Procedure)，Lodgement过程从移民局收到包裹那天开始算，一般不会超过3个工作天。
>
If your application is missing any of the above documents, your application will be returned to you, with a letter explaining that you must provide all mandatory documents before INZ will accept your application.
>
The lodgement process is supposed to take no more than 3 working days from the time INZ receive your application, as per Standard Operating Procedure.


## Allocation and Assessment 移民官的分配和申请评估

在Manukau处理团队的每个移民官给收到40-60份申请（新手40份，老手60+份）。当你的申请被分配到人时候，移民官根据技术移民操作指南(SMC immigration instructions)检查你交上去各种实体文件的细节。移民官负责检查你是否可以按流程交了材料，你claim的分数是不是够160分并且是否符合操作指南(SMC immigration instructions)。移民官有义务尽早完成这部分检查工作，与此同时去权衡申请评估用时和第三方检查间耗时间限制。当移民官快结束处理一批次申请的时候，新的申请档案会加个他的处理池中。这个处理池一般保持在40-60份申请。移民官收到新申请的时候，他们会开始初审(Initial Assessment)。
>
Every Immigration Officer in the SMC Processing Teams in Manukau has between 40 and 60 SMC applications assigned to their name at one time (40 for newer staff members but up to 60 for more senior staff members). When an application is allocated to an Immigration Officer, they are responsible for checking all the details and documents on the physical file against SMC immigration instructions and deciding whether the applicable instructions are met or not, and the claim for points that the applicant has made meets instructions & the client can be awarded 160+ points. An Immigration Officer is obliged to do this as quickly and efficiently as possible, while balancing the constraints of a robust assessment and third-party checks that need to be carried out. When an Immigration Officer creates space in their caseload of 40-60 applications due to finalising 1 or more applications, they are allocated new applications from the Managed Queue to “top up” their caseload to the 40-60 they are required to have at one time. New physical files are given to an Immigration Officer and they undertake an Initial Assessment.

初审会检查你材料里的每一页，看看有没有错误或者遗漏的信息，然后决定是不是需要核实分数(verification)。如果移民官发现你claim的分数不符合操作指南(immigration instructions)或者缺少支持材料的时候，初审会在材料被分配后的5个工作日内暂停。
>
An Initial Assessment involves checking over every single page contained in a physical application file, looking for any errors or missing information and deciding what verification needs to be undertaken. The Immigration Officer looks for any details where an applicant may have claimed points but does not actually meet immigration instructions and may ask an applicant to provide more information to help them make their assessment. This Initial Assessment is supposed to happen within 5 working days of the application being assigned to them.

移民官会用邮件通知你，你的申请已经分配到人，并且索取额外需要的材料。如果他们不需要额外材料，他们也会邮件告知你。
>
An Immigration Officer should send you an email to let you know they have been assigned your application and will ask for any extra information they need from you in that email. Or, if they don’t need anything else from you, they will advise you of this in the email and you don’t need to do anything further. 

移民官给你一个提供额外材料的截至日期。这些时间限制都有标准化时效指导，从3个工作日(少了材料或者细节)至10工作日(如果你是离岸申请或者等需要医学检查结果)。你最好尽快把需要的材料发给移民官。提供了材料之后，告知移民官以上就是你交的所有材料。这样做是因为有时候移民官会在截至日期之后再针对你的申请做下一步动作。这样做可以防止你交了一部分材料，之后又要补充别的材料造成的不便。如果你告诉移民官你交齐了材料，有助于移民官明确有哪些材料会进入做下一步评估。如果你不能如期提供，向他们申请延期，一般会同意的。通常最多10个工作日内（向第三方提出的材料除外）移民官会收集全你的材料，用来终审(final accessment)。
>
The Immigration Officer should give you a deadline by which it should be provided to them – there are standardised timeframe guidelines for all possible information and evidence that could ever be asked for by an Immigration Officer, ranging from 3 working days for simple details (such as a missing document or details in the application form) up to 10 working days for documents that might take longer to get (such as those from offshore or further medical tests from a specialist that you need to make an appointment with). Make sure you provide what the Immigration Officer is asking for as soon as you can, and once you have provided it, let them know that is all you are going to provide as sometimes an Immigration Officer will wait until the deadline has passed before taking any further action on your application just in case you are going to provide something else but haven’t made it clear to them that more is coming. Telling the Immigration Officer that you have provided all you are going to helps them to know that what they have is all that is coming to help them move on with their assessment. If you can’t make the deadline that the Immigration Officer has set, ask them for an extension – they are usually always granted. The longest it should take for an Immigration Officer to have everything they need to make a final assessment of an application (notwithstanding requests for extensions or delays with third parties) is 10 working days.

## Verification 核实分数
移民官会核实你申请中大多数claim的分数，一般会给雇主发邮件询问，但有时候会电话联系你的雇主。联系雇主是为了评估你的工作是否匹配ANZSCO上的职业描述、相关工作经验或者工作需要的文凭/资质(qualification)。移民官一般会询问雇主你的日常工作内容、聘用你的理由(比如工作经验或者qualification)。一般移民官会给雇主发一份问卷邮件，要求雇主5个工作日内完成。如果到时候没有收到雇主的回答，移民官会在截至日期的24小时内提出后续follow-up。移民官在收到问卷回复之后或者电话联系你或者雇主之后，要在3个工作日内做出下一步动作。
>
The majority of claims for skilled employment are verified by an Immigration Officer, usually via an email to your employer, but sometimes a phone call to you or your employer. What the Immigration Officer is trying to find out via these emails or phone calls is that your job substantially matches the ANZSCO description you have claimed for your employment and that you have the relevant work experience or qualification to do that job. Questions will usually focus on what you do in your job on a day-to-day basis and why your employer chose to offer the job to you (based on your previous work experience or qualification). An Immigration Officer will usually ask for the answers to a questionnaire sent via email to be returned by your employer within 5 working days. If they don’t receive the reply email within 5 working days, they are meant to follow-up with your employer within 24 hours of the deadline passing, and not just wait for the employer to reply when they choose to. When an Immigration Officer receives the reply from your employer (or talks to you or your employer on the phone), they are required to take the next action on your application within 3 working days.

下一步，移民官会写给你质疑信(如果他们觉得你的工作或者申请的某方面不符合操作指南immigration instructions)或做出终审。有时候他们会给雇主更多问题，要是有些东西不太写清楚的话。
>
The next action will either be writing you a PPI letter (if they don’t think your employment, or some other aspect of your application, meets immigration instructions) or making their final assessment. Sometimes they need to ask your employer even more questions, if there is something they are unclear of.

## PPI or Final Assessment 质疑信/终审

如果收到了PPI质疑信，你有10个工作日回复。尽可能多地提供有利证据，来消除移民官对你的疑虑(或者找个持牌移民顾问来帮忙，因为回复PPI很有技巧)。
>
If you receive a PPI letter, you will be given 10 working days to provide a response. Try to provide as much evidence as you can to back-up your response to the Immigration Officer’s concerns (or perhaps contact a licensed immigration adviser to assistance, as responding to PPI letters can be tricky).

在终审流程中，移民官会再次检查申请材料的每一页。差不多跟初审一样，但是这一次结合他们在“核实分数”阶段收集的材料。这其中包括：是否提出健康health或品行问题character issues的质疑(根据你体检和犯罪记录，包括移民局录入团队lodgement team代表你申请新西兰犯罪记录)、是否能证明你满足160+分(材料包括你寄出的文件、移民官询问的材料、PPI质疑信中的补充材料)。最后，他们会写一个总结报告，其中涵盖了你claim的分数、核实分数的过程、分数是否符合相关操作指南immigration instructions。这个报告会可能有几页长，但要求移民官2个工作日内完成。
>
For their final assessment, an Immigration Officer will do another check of every page of the application and documents submitted, much like they did for the Initial Assessment but this time there will be even more information for them to check including the details they obtained during their verification checks. They will check if there are any health or character issues that need to be addressed (based on information in your medicals and police certificates, including the NZ Police Certificate the lodgement team requested on your behalf) and check that you are eligible for 160+ points based on what you have provided with your application and what they have checked during verification, as well as what you have provided in response to a PPI letter if one was sent. They will then write up a case summary, which is a report covering all the points you have claimed, verification they have undertaken and details about whether you do or do not meet the immigration instructions that are applicable to your case. This report can be several pages long but should not take an Immigration Officer more than 2 working days to write up.

## Second Person Check 二次检查

一旦移民官完成了报告并向数据库提交了决定结果之后，申请会转到Technical Adviser这里做二次检查。这个步骤是为了确保移民官没有遗漏细节、根据操作指南做出的推理和决定结果合理可靠。如果Technical Adviser在检查中发现任何一点瑕疵，这个申请会退回到移民官手中做补救措施remedial work。根据标准作业流程Standard Operating Procedure，补救措施享有高优先级，必须在退回之后的3个工作日内完成，在一周内交还给Technical Adviser，但是越快越好。最终决定只取决于移民官，Technical Adviser不能要求移民官改变他们的决定。但是申请要被完整检查，终审的理由要充足可靠。对于获批的申请，二次检查一般要30分钟；对于被拒的申请，则要1个小时。
>
Once the Immigration has written up their case summary and recommended a decision on the database, the application goes forward to a Technical Adviser for a Second Person Check. This check is to ensure that an Immigration Officer has not failed to check any part of the application and that their rationale for the recommended decision (approve or decline) is robust and in line with instructions. If the Technical Adviser identifies a part of the application that the Immigration Officer has failed to check or there are flaws in their rationale, they will return the application to the Immigration Officer for remedial work. An Immigration Officer should make this remedial work their priority (absolutely must be actioned within 3 working days of the file being returned, as per Standard Operating Procedure) and return the updated file to the Technical Adviser as soon as possible (ideally within a week). The decision to approve or decline an application lies only with the Immigration Officer and a Technical Adviser can not request that an Immigration Officer change their decision – but the application must have been checked fully and the rationale must be full and robust. A Second Person Check takes around 30 minutes to complete for an approved application and around 1 hour for a declined application.

## Final decision 最终决定
二次检查通过之后，获批的申请会转到Support Team，他们会给你发AIP(预批信)和电子签证。被拒的申请会回到移民官手中，他会给你写一封拒绝信。
>
Once an approved application has been through the Second Person Check, the file goes to the Support Team who will issue the Approval letter and e-Visa and send it out. A declined application goes back to the Immigration Officer, who will write the Decline letter and send it out.
